## Usage Examples

### Simple Calculator Example

#### Setup and Configuration
1. Set up [AIQ Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQ Toolkit/blob/main/docs/source/1_intro/getting_started.md) 
2. Start workflow by following the [Simple Calculator Example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQ Toolkit/blob/main/examples/simple_calculator/README.md)
```bash
aiq serve --config_file=examples/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml
```

#### Testing the Calculator
Interact with the chat interface by prompting the agent with the message:
```
Is 4 + 4 greater than the current hour of the day?
```

### Human In The Loop (HITL) Example

#### Setup and Configuration
1. Set up [AIQ Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQ Toolkit/blob/main/docs/source/1_intro/getting_started.md) 
2. Start workflow by following the [HITL Example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/AIQ Toolkit/blob/main/examples/simple_human_in_the_loop/README.md)
```bash
aiq serve --config_file=examples/simple_human_in_the_loop/configs/config.yml
```

#### Configuring HITL Settings
Enable WebSocket mode in the settings panel for bidirectional real-time communication between the client and server.
